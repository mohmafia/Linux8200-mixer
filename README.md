# 🎛️ OpenMixer UI

**A scalable, skinnable, open-source digital mixer interface built with Godot 4 and Bash.**

OpenMixer UI is a modular interface for digital audio control — built to be extended, themed, and integrated into real-world audio workflows or embedded systems. While the overall project focuses on mixer logic and device routing, the **settings scene** is uniquely styled to resemble the internal PCB of a hardware mixer, complete with labeled components and a retro LCD-style system status display.

## 🚀 Features

- **Godot 4 UI** with GDScript for responsive, interactive control
- **Bash integration** for system-level tasks like device detection, routing, and installation
- **Scalable interface** with plans for full **SVG-based skinning**
- **Hover-based tooltips** in the settings scene for intuitive feedback
- **PCB-style layout** in the settings scene for a hardware-inspired visual experience
- **Modular design** — easy to extend with new devices, masters, or routing logic
- **Open source** and community-driven

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer         | Tech Used         |
|---------------|-------------------|
| UI & Logic    | Godot 4 (GDScript)|
| System Access | Bash scripting    |
| Assets        | PNG (JPG for now), SVG (planned) |
| Versioning    | Git + GitHub      |

## 🎨 Skins & Scalability

The current UI uses bitmap backgrounds (JPG), which limits scalability. We're actively working on **SVG-based skin support** to enable:

- Resolution-independent UI
- Custom themes and skins
- Dynamic layout scaling

If you're a designer or vector artist, your contributions are more than welcome!

---

## 🤝 Contributing

We’re looking for contributors who are passionate about:

- UI/UX design (especially SVG and scalable layouts)
- Godot development (GDScript, Control nodes, Theme system)
- Bash scripting and system integration
- Audio routing, DSP, or embedded systems

Every small contribution can have a big impact. Whether it's a new skin, a tooltip improvement, or a routing script — you're welcome here.

---

## 📦 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the project in Godot 4
3. Run the main scene (`install.tscn`) or `settings_lcd_panel.tscn`
4. Explore, test, and contribute!

> Bash scripts are located in `/scripts` and handle system-level logic.
